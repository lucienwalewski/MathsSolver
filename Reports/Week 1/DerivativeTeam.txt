# Week 1 report (to be completed by Sunday)

CSE201 Project
Week 01: Derivatives Team

Constance Ferragu, Merlin Beaufils, Marie Huynh,  Jean Paul Touret

What we did this week: 
- Researched and came up with the Classes structure for our project
	- AbstractFunction Class
	- Sin, cos, constant, exponential, polynomial, logarithmic Classes 
- Started thinking about the string manipulation and decomposition for the 
AbstractFunction Class constructor. 
- Decided to implement a vector object to represent the string of the function. Our input is a string --> converted to a vector --> converted to an AbstractFunction object. 

- We will represent the operations as an enumerator. 

- We split up the tasks:
	- Marie: converting the string to a vector 
	- Merlin: converting vector to AbstractFunction
	- Jeau Paul: converting AbstractFunction to string
	- Constance: .solve() function 


Base Function: 
- Sin (sin(x))
- Cos (cos(x)) 
- Constant (a)
- Exponential (a^x)
- polynomial (x^a)
- Logarithmic (log(x))

Operations: -, +, *, /, ⚬  

AbstractFunction Idea: 
- Input: a string that represents a function
	- Example: ‘(x+3) + (x^2)*cos(e^x) – (log(x))^4’
- Output: Linked nodes that represent the function. The branches represent operations, and each node has a left and right pointer
