This week as a group we successfully got the project up and running. Our function now compiles and in we will see how
it performs once the tests are fully functional. My contribution was to adapt the constructor to the Tokens. I also 
spent a few hours debugging all of the code in derivatives to make it compile properly.(my goal was originally to make a 
test file but this took much longer than expected).
